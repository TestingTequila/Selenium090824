TestNg: 3A's
TestNg is all about : Annotations[99%], Attributes[100%] and Assertions

1. Annotations: pre and post conditions and to identify the test case and to mostly decide execution order of test cases
   They are used along with methods
   @BeforeSuite
   @BeforeTest   : This will be executed only once for all the test cases beforeClass
   @BeforeClass  : This will be executed only once for all the test cases beforeMethod
   @BeforeMethod : This will be executed before every Test case [@Test]
   @Test         : To identify or mark the test case
   @AfterMethod  : This will be executed after every Test case [@Test]
   @AfterClass   : This will be executed only once for all the test cases after
   @AfterTest    : This will be executed only once for all the test cases afterClass
   @AfterSuite
   ----------------------------------
   @Parameters: used to implement parametrization in test cases means to execute same test case with different test data
   @dataProvider

   ===================================================================
   Attributes: They provide more flexibility to our already automated test cases
             : We can use attributes along with Annotations only
